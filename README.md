# Effects of Backtracking on PageRank

This repository contains the code used to generate and analyze data related to backtracking variants of PageRank. Any questions about this code should be directed to the corresponding author(s) of Glover, Cory, et al. "Effects of Backtracking on PageRank." arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.13353 (2022).

The repository contains three Python Scripts.
The first contains functions helpful for analyzing non-backtracking matrices.
The second establishes functions used to calculate PageRank, Non-Backtracking PageRank, and Infinite-PageRank as wells as the implementation of Infinite-PageRank clustering.

There are additionally two jupyter notebooks.
The first performs analysis on comparing distributions of PageRank values and the second applies infinite-PageRank clustering to generate stochastic block model networks.

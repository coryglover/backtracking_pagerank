# Effects of Backtracking on PageRank

This repository contains the code used to generate and analyze data related to backtracking variants of PageRank. Any questions about this code should be directed to the corresponding author(s) of Glover, Cory, et al. "Effects of Backtracking on PageRank." arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.13353 (2022).

The repository contains three Python Scripts.
The first establishes functions used to calculate PageRank, Non-Backtracking PageRank, and Infinite-PageRank.
The second compares the distribution of PageRank values across variants of PageRank.
The third performs infinite-PageRank clustering as described in the aforementioned paper.

There are additionally two jupyter notebooks.
The first performs analysis on comparing distributions of PageRank values and the second applies infinite-PageRank clustering to generate stochastic block model networks.
